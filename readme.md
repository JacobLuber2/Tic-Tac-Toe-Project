# Tic-Tac-Toe
## About
-An interactive web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game that allows two players to take turns, keeps track of the board state, announces the winner, or declares a tie if no one wins.
-I made this as an optional project for the TrueCoders Full-Stack Web Development course to demonstrate my competence in object-oriented programming.


## Usage:

- If you have 3 of your symbols back to back in any order (row, coulumn, diagonal) You won!
